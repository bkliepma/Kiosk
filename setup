This project is to set up a digital picture frame that 1) never needs to be touched at the frame (no maintenance) 2) can be updated by anyone with the correct credentials and a computer (no/minimal training) 3) doesn't require the frame and the updater to be on the same network (allows the frame to be on a public network with minimal access)

You will need a Raspberry Pi (this was originally set up with RPi 2, but could be done with a 3), an HDMI-enabled screen such as a TV, and one each of an HDMI and micro-USB cable.
